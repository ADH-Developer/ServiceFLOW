## Notes on Testing Strategy 📝

Testing has been moved to the post-MVP phase to expedite the delivery of core functionality. This decision was made to:
- Focus resources on stabilizing current features
- Get user feedback earlier
- Allow for more flexible initial development
- Better understand testing requirements based on actual usage

Once the MVP is stable and in production:
1. We will implement comprehensive testing
2. Prioritize critical path testing
3. Add regression tests for reported issues
4. Set up automated testing pipeline

## Development Guidelines 📋

1. Focus on stability over new features
2. Prioritize user experience
3. Keep code maintainable
4. Document as you go
5. Consider scalability in design decisions
6. Follow security best practices
7. Maintain consistent code style
