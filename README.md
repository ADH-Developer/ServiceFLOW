<h2>ServiceFLOW - (FLOW = Flexible  Logistics  Operations  Workflows)</h2>

<h3>Why:</h3>
Modern service shops face a triad of challenges: maintaining customer trust, optimizing workflows, and fostering transparency across teams. ServiceFlow was created to address these pain points by transforming how service shops communicate, manage tasks, and deliver results. By prioritizing openness and leveraging technology, ServiceFlow empowers mechanics, advisors, and managers to build trust and drive efficiency—every step of the way. 

<h3>What:</h3>
ServiceFlow is a role-based web application designed to streamline service shop operations through transparency and collaboration. It centralizes work orders, inspections, approvals, and parts management into a unified platform. The app fosters trust with customers by incorporating visual documentation (photos/videos), transparent approval workflows, and real-time status updates. Tailored dashboards ensure mechanics, advisors, and managers operate with clarity and focus, while integrations with tools like QuickBooks enhance financial and inventory efficiency.

<h3>How:</h3>
Built with a scalable and modern tech stack, ServiceFlow combines the power of Django for backend robustness and Next.js for dynamic, responsive user interfaces. The application emphasizes rapid development and modular design to accommodate future scalability.
