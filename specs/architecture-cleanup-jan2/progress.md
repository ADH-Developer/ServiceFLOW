  - Added proper Jest setup file
  - Configured TypeScript for Jest tests
  - Added WebSocket and localStorage mocks
  - Fixed type definition issues
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive test suite
  - API error handling tests
  - WebSocket integration tests
  - Authentication flow tests
  - Concurrent operation tests

#### Current Focus
- Running and debugging test suite
- Adding more edge cases for error handling
- Documenting test patterns and mocking strategies

#### Next Steps
1. Run and verify all tests
2. Add more edge cases to error handling tests
3. Document test patterns in README
4. Add test coverage reporting

#### Blockers
None at this time. All TypeScript/Jest configuration issues have been resolved.

#### Notes
