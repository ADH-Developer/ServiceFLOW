## Current Focus
- Completed TypeScript configuration updates
- Next: Test build process with new configurations
- Planning dependencies audit

## Blockers
- None currently identified

## Next Steps
1. Test build process with new configurations
2. Begin dependencies audit
3. Update package versions

## Notes
- Development can continue with current setup while changes are implemented
- Each phase will be tested thoroughly before moving to the next
- Changes will be committed in small, reversible chunks
- Hot reloading is now working correctly with Next.js setup
- Babel configuration now uses Next.js defaults for better compatibility
- TypeScript configuration enhanced with stricter type checking
