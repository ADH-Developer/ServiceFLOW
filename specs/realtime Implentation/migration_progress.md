## Current Status
The migration has been completed successfully. We have completed all backend changes, frontend changes, Docker configuration updates, and environment updates. Testing has shown that Socket.IO connections are working correctly, all real-time features are functioning as expected, and the system handles edge cases (network disconnections and server restarts) gracefully. The only remaining task is to test the production environment setup.

### Next Steps
1. Test the Docker setup in the production environment
2. Monitor the system for any potential issues
3. Document the completed migration
4. Consider any performance optimizations or improvements based on production testing
